# CollegeDataAnalysis

This script is designed to analyze and classify college data using Python. It utilizes several popular Python libraries, including pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn, as well as various machine learning algorithms.

## Functionality 

analyze_college_data(data_path): This function loads the college dataset from the specified path and performs data analysis and visualization. It displays basic information about the dataset, a correlation heatmap, scatter plots, kernel density estimation plots, and more to provide a better understanding of the dataset.

classify_college_data(data_path): This function also loads the college dataset from the specified path, preprocesses the data and selects features, and then trains and evaluates multiple classification algorithm models. It returns evaluation metrics for each model, including recall, accuracy, precision, and F1 score.

## Technical Stack

Data Processing: pandas
Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn
Machine Learning Algorithm Models: Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, CatBoost from scikit-learn library.

## How to Run the Program

Download this program to your local machine.
Run the program on your local machine.
Ensure the 'College_Data.csv' file is in the working directory or update the file path accordingly.
The program will execute various analyses, generate visualizations, and save the results in an output PDF file named 'output_report.pdf'.

# Example of Running the Program

Run the program using the provided execution instructions.
The program will automatically load the 'College_Data.csv' file for analysis.
Ensure the CSV file is present in the /content/ directory.
The results of the analyses and visualizations will be saved in 'output_report.pdf' and can be viewed for insights into the college dataset.
Descriptive visualizations and analytics (e.g., pie charts, countplots, barplots) showing various aspects of college data.

## Notes

Make sure you have installed the necessary Python libraries, such as pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, xgboost, catboost, etc.
